= buddybuild REST API documentation

== Overview

The buddybuild API is a RESTful interface, providing programmatic access
to much of the data in the system. It provides predictable URLs for
accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands
and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with from a wide
variety of environments, from command-line utilities to client libraries
to apps.

The API accepts JSON or form-encoded content in requests and returns
JSON content in all of its responses, including errors. Only the UTF-8
character encoding is supported for both requests and responses.

At this time the buddybuild API responds to a single version of the API.
All resources are available under the https://api.buddybuild.com/v1/
base URL.

== Authentication

Each user in buddybuild has their own unique *Personal Access Token*,
which can be used to talk to buddybuild on behalf of the user.

[NOTE]
======
**Looking for your API access token?**

To obtain your personal access token sign in to the buddybuild
dashboard, hover over your profile icon and select *My Profile*, then
select *Access Token* in the left menu. Or visit this direct link to
link:https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/account/access-token[your personal
access token^]
======

{% method %}
Personal access tokens should be used when accessing the API, passing
them in the `Authorization` header. Remember to keep your token secret,
treating it just like a password. It acts on your behalf when
interacting with the API. Don’t hardcode them into your programs;
instead opt to use them as environment variables.

{% sample lang="json" %}
.Using personal access tokens in requests
[source,json,subs="normal"]
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [apitoken]_api-access-token_" \
  '\https://api.buddybuild.com/v1/apps'

{% endmethod %}

== Percent Encoding

Many of the buddybuild API methods accept URL parameters that must be
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[percent encoded] to
avoid conflicts with reserved characters. Reserved characters are those
characters that sometimes have special meaning in a URL.

For example, when passing a Git branch named `feature/find&replace` as a
`branch` parameter it must be percent encoded as
`feature%2Ffind%26replace`.

== Errors

Sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can occur for
a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API returns an HTTP Status
Code that indicates the reason for the failure, with a response body in
JSON format containing additional information.

[cols="^10a,35a,100a", options="header"]
|===
| Code
| Reason
| Description

| 200
| OK
| Request succeeded, and the data requested is included in the response body.

| 201
| Created
| The request to create a resource succeeded. The ID of the newly created
  resource may be returned in the response body.

| 204
| No Content
| Request succeeded, but no data is returned.

| 400
| Bad Request
| This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check
  the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again.

| 401
| Unauthorized
| A valid API personal access token was not provided with the request,
  so the API could not associate a user with the request.

| 404
| Not Found
| Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known
  action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not
  exist.

| 500
| Server Error
| There was a problem on buddybuild’s end. Contact support.

| 503
| Service Unavailable
| The buddybuild API server is temporarily unavailable because it is
  overloaded or down for maintenance. Check http://status.buddybuild.com/

In the event of an error, the response body contains an `error`
field at the top level. This error message provides more detail about
the error that occurred, if available.
